# Final Project Overview and Scenario

### OVERVIEW 

Now that you have been equipped with the knowledge and skills to develop and deploy a full-stack Django app, you will have the opportunity in the final project to practice and apply your skills by adding new features to a Django online course app.

### FINAL PROJECT SCENARIO 

In this scenario, you have recently joined a new development team as a full-stack Django developer. The development team has started building a minimum viable product (MVP) of an online course app. 

Based on the user feedback, the stakeholders of the product have planned to add an assessment feature to the online course web app to evaluate learners. For the new assessment feature, instructors should be able to create exams with questions, and learners should be able to complete the course if they pass the exam. 

As a new team member, the lead developer has assigned this new feature to you. You will need to leverage your Django full-stack skills to design and implement models, templates, and views. 

### OVERVIEW OF PROJECT TASKS

You will complete the final project by performing the following tasks:

1. Understand project requirements and download/gitclone the MVP app
2. Build assessment-related models and templates
3. Develop new app functionalities to submit, display, and evaluate exam results
4. Run and test your app

We have prepared four instructional labs to help you complete the final project.
